# README

## I use VSC[^1] and not Android Studio because I'm more familiar with VSC, since we're stuck on Chromebooks, we have to use the browser versions and Android Studio doesn't have a browser version as far as I know.

I want to document **The Battle of the Engineers and the Programmer**, daily the engineers change the robot by adding or removing different ideas and I have to figure out what does and doesn't stay in the code. So, if you see a bunch of commented code, that's why.

(I'm legally obligated to say that this is not against the engineers. This is stated for the programmer.)

[^1]: Visual Studio Code
