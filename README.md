# After-season: No Name

Since Centerstage is over, we've decided to create a custom game in which we'll be building a different robot!
I hope to make this branch unique compared to the boring previous one.
I'll be adding images for versions that I feel need image context.
Check out the [change log](https://github.com/Galabeam/FTC-SLCSD-Robot/blob/afterseason-noname/CHANGELOG.md) for images and other information.
